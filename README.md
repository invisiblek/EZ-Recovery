Whipped up this quick and dirty little app to make switching between recoveries pain free.
This does require root!

None of the recovery development is my own, so thanks to all the devs that made this possible.

IMPORTANT: Flashing Invisiblek's kernel will replace your recovery. If you need to access backup and flashing functionality, you'll have to flash back to TWRP or CWM first.
